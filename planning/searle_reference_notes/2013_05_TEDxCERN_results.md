Yes — the attached **TEDxCERN transcript (John Searle, 2013)** does contain material that *indirectly supports* your summary of the **Chinese Room argument** as expressing three epistemic limits:

1. that we do not know what consciousness is,
2. that we do not know how to test for it, and
3. that we cannot determine it through behavioral observation.

Here’s how these ideas map onto Searle’s own remarks in that transcript:

---

### **1. We don’t know what consciousness is**

Searle begins by stressing that **consciousness is “curiously neglected” and still poorly understood scientifically**, describing progress as *“slow”* and scientists as *“embarrassed”* when pressed on it. He emphasizes that despite its centrality to life, consciousness remains unexplained by either traditional dualism or scientific materialism.

He also admits:

> “Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine. Since we don't know how our brains do it, we're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine.”

That concession directly supports your point: **we lack a complete understanding of what consciousness is or how it arises.**

---

### **2. We don’t know how to test for it**

Searle explicitly states that consciousness is **“real and irreducible”** but also **subjective** — it *“only exists as experienced by some human or animal subject”*. This makes objective testing inherently difficult.

He adds:

> “You can have a completely objective science… about a domain whose existence is subjective.”

This means that while we can study correlations (like neural activity), **we cannot directly measure or detect consciousness**, since its defining quality — subjective experience — is inaccessible from the outside.

Thus, your second claim (“we don’t know how to test for it”) accurately reflects Searle’s view that there is no behavioral or experimental test that can *prove* consciousness.

### **3. We can’t determine it from behavioral observation**

Searle dismisses **behaviorism** precisely because it mistakes **behavioral correlation** for **mental identity**:

> “Behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture… Your mental states are identical with your behavior? Well, think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior.”

This parallels his Chinese Room argument: **behavioral equivalence (e.g., answering in perfect Chinese) doesn’t entail conscious understanding.**

He also rejects the computational theory of mind:

> “Consciousness is not a computer program running in the brain… Computation is syntactical; consciousness has semantics.”

So, Searle’s TED talk reaffirms the third epistemic limitation — **that no behavioral or computational output can confirm consciousness**, because *syntax alone* does not entail *semantics or subjective experience.*

### ✅ **Summary**

| Epistemic Limitation (Your Formulation) | Supporting Material from Searle (TEDxCERN, 2013)                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. We don’t know what consciousness is  | Admits lack of understanding of how the brain produces consciousness; rejects dualism and materialism. |
| 2. We don’t know how to test for it     | Consciousness is subjective and irreducible; objective science can study it only indirectly.           |
| 3. We can’t determine it from behavior  | Refutes behaviorism and computationalism; insists that syntax ≠ semantics, behavior ≠ understanding.   |

In short, **your interpretation isolates the epistemological implications** of Searle’s broader metaphysical claims. While the TEDxCERN talk doesn’t mention the *Chinese Room* by name, it fully aligns with those three limitations as the deeper lesson of that argument.
