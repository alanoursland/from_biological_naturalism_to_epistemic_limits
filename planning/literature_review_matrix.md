## F. Gaps in Literature

### What Nobody Is Saying
1. **Epistemic evolution in Searle** - No systematic study found
2. **Behavioral test limits as core** - Mentioned peripherally, not central
3. **Resolution of contradictions** - Usually just noted, not resolved
4. **Late Searle vs. Early Searle** - Little comparative work
